# Require setup and teardown to be within a hook (`vitest/require-hook`)

⚠️ This rule _warns_ in the 🌐 `all` config.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

It's common when writing tests to need to perform a particular setup work before and after a test suite run.  Because Vitest executes all `describe` handlers in a test file _before_ it executes any of the actual tests, it's important to ensure setup and teardown work is done inside `before*` and `after*` handlers respectively, rather than inside the `describe` blocks.

## Details 

This rule flags any expression that is either at the toplevel of a test file or directly within the body of a `describe` except the following:

- `import` statements
- `const` variables
- `let` _declarations_ and initializations to `null` or `undefined`
- Classes
- Types

This rule flags any function within in a `describe` block and suggest wrapping them in one of the four lifecycle hooks.


The following patterns are considered warnings:

```ts
import { database } from './api'

describe('foo', () => {
   database.connect()

   test('bar', () => {
	 // ...
   })

   database.disconnect()
})
```



The following patterns are not warnings:



```ts
describe('foo', () => {
   before(() => {
	 database.connect()
   })

   test('bar', () => {
	 // ...
   })
})
```


## Options

If there are methods that you want to call outside of hooks and tests, you can mark them as allowed using the `allowedFunctionCalls` option.


```json
{
  "vitest/require-hook": ["error", {
	"allowedFunctionCalls": ["database.connect"]
  }]
}
```

The following patterns are not warnings because `database.connect` is allowed:

```ts
import { database } from './api'

describe('foo', () => {
   database.connect()

   test('bar', () => {
	 // ...
   })

   database.disconnect()
})
```
