When tests are empty it's better to mark them as `test.todo` as it will be highlighted in tests summary output.

### Rule details

The following pattern is considered a warning:

```js
test('foo');
test('foo', () => {})
test.skip('foo', () => {})
```

The following pattern is not considered a warning:

```js
test.todo('foo');
```
